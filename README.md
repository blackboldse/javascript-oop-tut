### First class

### First instances

### Inheritance

### Encapsulation

### Polymorphism

### Abstract classes

Abstract class is a class which can't be instantiated and require subclasses which inherit from a particular abstract class to provice implementations. We will change the animal class to an abstract class. It will not be possilbe to create a instance of this class anymore like on slide number 3 and we will mark makeSound as an abstract method - in order to use it, a subclass must declare its own implementation of this method.
